Assalamu Alaikum Sir-

The total number of pages in your figma file was 5 pages.

I am putting the first page on the home router. If you click on Home, you will see the home page. And I'm putting the second page on the buy router, if you click buy you can see the buy page. And if you click See all properties inside the Buy page, you will go to the third page (properties (400)). And if you click on the (Bid Properties) button inside the (Properties (400)) page, you will be taken to page number four. And if you click on About Router, you will go to page number five.
